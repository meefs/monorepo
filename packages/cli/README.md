# Update existing fieldguides
outfitter fieldguides update

# Create a new fieldguide
outfitter fieldguides create

# Configure fieldguide settings
outfitter fieldguides config
```

## Configuration

Projects initialized with Outfitter have a `.outfitter/` directory containing:

```
.outfitter/
├── config.json      # Project configuration and installed supplies
├── supplies/        # Local copies of installed supplies
└── cache/          # Version and update cache
```

### config.json

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "preset": "nextjs",
  "supplies": [
    "typescript-standards",
    "react-patterns",
    "nextjs-patterns",
    "testing-standards"
  ],
  "installed": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Packlists

Packlists allow you to share and standardize supply configurations across teams.

### Creating a Packlist

```bash
# Export your current setup
outfitter pack export --output frontend-standard.json
```

### Using a Packlist

```bash
# In a new project
outfitter init
outfitter pack import frontend-standard.json
```

### Packlist Format

```json
{
  "name": "Frontend Standard",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "supplies": ["typescript-standards", "react-patterns", "testing-standards"],
  "created": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Available Supplies

### Standards

- `typescript-standards` - Core TypeScript patterns and conventions
- `testing-standards` - Comprehensive testing methodology
- `security-standards` - Security baseline and best practices
- `documentation-standards` - Clear documentation guidelines

### Patterns

- `react-patterns` - React component and hook patterns
- `nextjs-patterns` - Next.js specific patterns
- `typescript-error-handling` - Error handling patterns

## Integration with AI Assistants

Use the `--with-claude` flag during initialization to create a `CLAUDE.md` file
that references your installed supplies:

```bash
outfitter init --preset react --with-claude
```

This creates a CLAUDE.md that helps AI assistants understand your project's
standards and patterns.
