Features:

  - Unified configuration system for modern development toolchains
  - Define preferences once in `.outfitter/config.jsonc`
  - Automatically generates tool-specific configs for Biome, ESLint, Prettier, and VS Code
  - Support for exact syntax overrides using native tool configuration
  - Tool selection control (choose which tool handles which file types)
  - Language-specific settings support
  - Zero runtime dependencies (uses peer dependencies for actual tools)
  - Full TypeScript support with comprehensive types
