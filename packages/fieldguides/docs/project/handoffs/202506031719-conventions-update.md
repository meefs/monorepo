# Fieldguides Conventions Update Summary

## Overview

Updated the fieldguides conventions to align with 2025 best practices, emphasizing modern tooling and patterns while removing outdated approaches.

## Key Updates Made

### 1. TypeScript Conventions (`typescript-conventions.md`)

**Compiler Configuration Updates:**

- Added `moduleDetection: "force"` for better module handling
- Added `useDefineForClassFields: true` for ES2022 class fields
- Added `allowUnreachableCode: false` and `allowUnusedLabels: false`
- Updated lib to `es2023` (latest stable)

**ESLint Modernization:**

- Replaced legacy `.eslintrc` format with flat config (`eslint.config.js`)
- Updated to use `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked` and `stylisticTypeChecked`
- Enabled `projectService` API for better performance
- Removed outdated `I` prefix convention for interfaces
- Added modern rules like `strict-boolean-expressions` and `prefer-ts-expect-error`

**New Security Patterns:**

- Opaque types for sensitive data (Password, ApiKey)
- Template literal types for API endpoint safety
- Validation patterns with type predicates
- Secure data handling with `toJSON()` prevention

**Performance Patterns:**

- `satisfies` operator for type validation without widening
- `as const` assertions for optimization

### 2. Testing Organization (`testing-organization.md`)

**Modern File Structure:**

- Vitest-first approach with colocated tests
- Added benchmark files (`*.bench.ts`) for performance testing
- In-source testing feature for pure utilities
- Separate e2e directory for Playwright tests

**Vitest Configuration:**

- Complete `vitest.config.ts` setup with React support
- Happy-dom environment (faster than jsdom)
- MSW 2.0 setup for API mocking
- Modern test utilities with full TypeScript types

**New Features:**

- In-source testing examples
- Performance benchmarking patterns
- Enhanced custom render with all providers

### 3. Testing Philosophy (`testing-philosophy.md`)

**TDD Workflow Updates:**

- Modern examples using Vitest syntax
- Commit convention integration ([RED], [GREEN], [REFACTOR])
- Enhanced edge case testing

**Testing Diamond Model:**

- Replaced pyramid with diamond shape
- More component tests (30-40%)
- Added performance tests (5-10%)
- Better balance for modern applications

**Tool Recommendations:**

- Vitest as primary recommendation
- Clear guidance on when to use Jest
- Modern test quality indicators
- Updated code examples with current patterns

### 4. Conventions README

**Enhanced Metadata:**

- Added proper frontmatter fields
- Clear categorization and tagging
- Cross-references to related guides

**Modern Focus:**

- Emphasized 2025 best practices
- Prioritized type safety and performance
- Clear positioning as opinionated, modern-first

## Breaking Changes

1. **ESLint Configuration**: Projects must migrate from legacy to flat config
2. **Interface Naming**: Removed `I` prefix convention
3. **Testing Framework**: Vitest is now the primary recommendation

## Migration Notes

For existing projects:

1. ESLint configs need to be converted to flat format
2. Interface names with `I` prefix should be renamed
3. Consider migrating Jest tests to Vitest for better performance

## Verification

All changes have been validated:

- ✅ Frontmatter validation passed
- ✅ Cross-references fixed and verified
- ✅ Code examples are modern and correct
- ✅ Security patterns added

## Next Steps

1. Update any project templates to use these new conventions
2. Create migration guides for teams moving from old patterns
3. Monitor TypeScript/Vitest releases for future updates
