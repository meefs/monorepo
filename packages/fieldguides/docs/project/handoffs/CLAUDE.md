# Handoff Formatting Guide

This guide provides the structure and formatting conventions for creating project handoff documents.

## Template Structure

Every handoff should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Title of Change/Feature]

## Overview

[2-3 sentence summary of what was done and why it matters]

## Context

[Background information that led to this work]
[Problem statement or requirements]
[Links to related issues/PRs if applicable]

## Key Changes

### 1. [Major Change Area]

[Description of what changed]
[Why this approach was chosen]

### 2. [Another Change Area]

[Continue for all significant changes]

## Technical Details

### Architecture Decisions

[Key architectural choices made]
[Trade-offs considered]

### Implementation Notes

[Important implementation details]
[Patterns used]
[Dependencies added/removed]

## Breaking Changes

[List any breaking changes]
[Migration steps required]

## Verification

```

## Writing Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Include file paths, function names, and concrete examples
2. **Explain Why**: Document not just what changed, but why decisions were made
3. **Think Future**: Write for someone (including yourself) reading this months later
4. **Include Examples**: Show code snippets for complex changes
5. **List Commands**: Include any commands needed for migration or testing

## Common Sections

### For Refactoring

- Before/after code examples
- Performance improvements measured

### For New Features

- API documentation
- Usage examples

### For Bug Fixes

- Root cause analysis
