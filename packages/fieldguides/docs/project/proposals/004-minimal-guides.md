# Proposal: Create Minimal Guides

## Summary

Create "quick start" minimal guides in the `/guides` directory that provide entry points to deeper documentation. These guides should be named `<subject>-guide.md` and serve as concise starting points for developers.

## Background

Currently, the `/guides` directory contains library-specific implementation guides (React Hook Form, React Query, etc.). We need to add minimal guides that:

- Provide quick-start information for common topics
- Link out to more detailed patterns, standards, and conventions
- Serve as navigation aids for the broader documentation

## Proposed Guides

### Priority 1 - Core Technology Guides

- `typescript-guide.md` - Getting started with TypeScript in projects
- `testing-guide.md` - Overview of testing approach and tools
- `react-guide.md` - Quick start for React development
- `nextjs-guide.md` - Getting started with Next.js

### Priority 2 - Process Guides

- `deployment-guide.md` - Overview of deployment processes
- `configuration-guide.md` - Managing app configuration
- `monitoring-guide.md` - Setting up observability

### Priority 3 - Architecture Guides

- `monorepo-guide.md` - Working with monorepo structure
- `component-guide.md` - Component development patterns

## Guide Structure

Each minimal guide should follow this structure:

```markdown
---
slug: <subject>-guide
title: Quick start guide for <subject>
description: Essential information to get started with <subject>.
type: guide
---

# <Subject> Guide

Brief introduction (2-3 sentences).

## Quick Start

- Essential setup steps
- Key commands
- Basic example

## Key Concepts

Brief overview of important concepts (bullet points).

## Related Documentation

### Standards

- Link to relevant standards

### Patterns

- Link to implementation patterns

### Conventions

- Link to team conventions

### Tools & Libraries

- Link to specific tool guides

## Common Tasks

- Task 1: Brief description → [Link to detailed docs]
- Task 2: Brief description → [Link to detailed docs]

## Next Steps

Guidance on where to go next for deeper understanding.
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Navigation** - Clear entry points for each technology area
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Start simple, dive deep when needed
3. **Better Onboarding** - New developers can quickly orient themselves
4. **AI-Friendly** - Provides context and navigation paths for AI agents

## Implementation Plan

1. Create template for minimal guides
2. Write Priority 1 guides first
3. Gather feedback and iterate on format
4. Complete Priority 2 and 3 guides
5. Update main README to highlight minimal guides

## Success Criteria

- Each guide is under 150 lines
- All guides follow consistent structure
- Cross-references are accurate and helpful
- New developers report improved documentation navigation
