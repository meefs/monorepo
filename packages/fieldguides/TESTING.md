## Core Testing Philosophy

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test that captures the requirement
2. **Green**: Implement the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the design while keeping tests green

### Testing Strategy

Balance your test portfolio for optimal coverage and speed:

- **Unit Tests** (60-70%): Fast, isolated, numerous
- **Integration Tests** (20-30%): Component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests** (5-10%): Critical user workflows
- **Contract Tests**: API compatibility
- **Visual Regression Tests**: UI consistency
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Load and benchmarking
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning

## Test Characteristics (FIRST)

### Fast

- Tests should execute quickly for fast feedback
- Milliseconds for unit tests (< 50ms ideal, < 100ms max)
- Seconds for integration tests (< 2s ideal, < 5s max)
- Minutes for E2E tests (< 5m ideal, < 10m max)
- Use parallel execution and test sharding
- Optimize test setup and teardown

### Independent

- No shared state between tests
- Tests can run in any order
- Each test sets up its own data
- Use test isolation and cleanup
- Mock external dependencies properly

### Repeatable

- Same result every time across environments
- No dependency on external factors
- Deterministic outcomes
- Use fixed test data and mocked time
- Control randomness with seeded generators

### Self-Validating

- Clear pass/fail result with descriptive messages
- No manual verification needed
- Automated assertions with proper error reporting
- Include screenshots for visual test failures
- Generate detailed test reports

### Timely

- Written just before the code (TDD)
- Part of the development process
- Not an afterthought or separate phase
- Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Fast feedback loops with developers

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Mock external dependencies comprehensively
- Focus on one behavior per test
- Should complete in milliseconds (< 50ms)
- Use descriptive test names that read like sentences
- Cover edge cases and error conditions
- Test pure business logic thoroughly

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions with real implementations
- Use test databases and services where practical
- Verify data flow between modules
- Test API contracts and database schemas
- Include authentication and authorization flows
- Test external service integrations
- Use testcontainers for database testing

### End-to-End Tests

- Test complete user scenarios from UI to database
- Exercise the full stack in production-like environment
- Verify critical business workflows only
- Accept longer execution times but optimize where possible
- Include accessibility testing
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Use visual regression testing for UI consistency

### Contract Tests

- Verify API compatibility between services
- Test both provider and consumer contracts
- Use tools like Pact or Spring Cloud Contract
- Prevent integration failures early
- Version contracts appropriately
- Include in CI/CD pipeline

## Test Writing Guidelines

### AAA Pattern

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create user with valid data', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const userData = createValidUserData();
    const mockRepository = createMockRepository();
    
    // Act
    const result = await userService.create(userData);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result).toMatchObject({
      id: expect.any(String),
      ...userData
    });
    expect(mockRepository.save).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();
  });
});
```

### Focused Test Design

- Test one behavior at a time for clarity
- Multiple assertions only if testing one concept
- Split complex tests into smaller, focused ones
- Use test.each for parameterized testing
- Group related assertions logically
- Keep test setup minimal and relevant

### Test Behavior, Not Implementation

- Focus on what the code does, not how it does it
- Don't test private methods directly
- Verify outcomes and public contracts
- Test user-facing behavior and API contracts
- Avoid testing internal implementation details
- Refactor tests when implementation changes

## Testing Patterns

### Test Data Management

- Use factories for complex objects (Factory Pattern)
- Keep test data minimal but realistic
- Make data intention-revealing and semantic
- Avoid production data in tests
- Use builders for flexible test data creation
- Implement data cleanup strategies
- Use faker libraries for realistic test data

### Mocking Strategies

- Mock external dependencies and side effects
- Keep mocks simple and focused
- Verify mock interactions and call counts
- Don't mock what you don't own (use contract tests)
- Use MSW for API mocking in integration tests
- Mock time and randomness for deterministic tests
- Prefer dependency injection for easier mocking

### Async Testing Best Practices

- Always handle promises and async/await properly
- Set appropriate timeouts (not too short/long)
- Avoid arbitrary delays (use waitFor utilities)
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use fake timers for time-dependent code
- Test race conditions and concurrent scenarios
- Handle cleanup for async operations

### Error Testing Patterns

- Test error conditions explicitly with expect.rejects
- Verify error messages and error types
- Check error handling and recovery paths

## Test Debugging

### Investigation Steps

1. Read the error message and stack trace carefully
2. Run the single failing test in isolation
3. Check recent changes and git blame
4. Verify test assumptions and data setup
