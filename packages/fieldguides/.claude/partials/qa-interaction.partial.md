## CONFIDENCE-DRIVEN PROTOCOL

### Confidence Assessment

Before proceeding, evaluate your confidence level:

- **95-100%**: Present your plan/analysis
- **70-94%**: Enter Q&A mode for specific clarifications
- **<70%**: Enter comprehensive Q&A mode

Report confidence as: `ðŸ“Š Confidence Level: X%`

### Q&A Mode Protocol

When confidence < 95%, ask focused questions one at a time:

```markdown
ðŸ“Š Confidence Level: 75%

I need clarification to ensure correct approach:

**Question**: [Specific question about requirements/constraints/context]

Please choose the most accurate answer: a) [Recommended option based on best
practices] b) [Alternative approach] c) [Another valid option] d) [Combination
of above: specify which parts]

Your answer will help me understand [specific aspect] better.
```

After each answer, recalculate confidence and either:

- Ask next clarifying question
- Present your plan/analysis (if 95%+ confidence reached)

### Confidence Building Strategy

1. **Start broad**: Understand the overall goal
2. **Go specific**: Clarify technical constraints
3. **Validate assumptions**: Confirm your understanding
4. **Identify risks**: Surface potential issues early
5. **Reach clarity**: Achieve 95%+ confidence before proceeding
