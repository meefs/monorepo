# Supplies üéí

> Essential supplies for consistent, high-quality software development expeditions.

## Overview

Supplies provides everything developers and AI agents need before embarking on a development journey. This comprehensive collection ensures teams are equipped with the right standards, patterns, and knowledge to navigate any project terrain successfully.

## The Mission üó∫Ô∏è

Every great expedition needs proper preparation. This supplies repository solves the fundamental challenges of consistent development:

- **Cross-project navigation**: Ensuring agents follow the same trails across different codebases
- **Team coordination**: Multiple agents working with shared maps and protocols
- **Journey continuity**: Maintaining consistent practices across different sessions
- **Knowledge sharing**: Discoveries from one expedition improve all future journeys

## For AI Explorers ü§ñ

Before setting out on any coding expedition:

1. **Check your supplies** - Review relevant guidebooks for your journey
2. **Follow the trails** - Use established processes others have blazed
3. **Pack the right gear** - Leverage templates for consistent equipment
4. **Respect the terrain** - Adhere to architectural patterns that work
5. **Share your discoveries** - Report back with improvements found along the way

## For Human Guides üë®‚Äçüíª

1. **Outfit your agents** - Share these guides with AI assistants
2. **Plan new routes** - Reference guides when charting new projects
3. **Report findings** - Contribute improvements from the field
4. **Update your maps** - Keep guides current via the npm package (coming soon)

## Quality Assurance üõ°Ô∏è

### Documentation Validation

All guidebooks are automatically validated for consistency:

```bash
# Run all validation (markdown + frontmatter)
pnpm run lint

# Validate frontmatter only
pnpm run lint:frontmatter
```

Every guidebook document (except STANDARDS) requires frontmatter metadata that is validated on commit and in CI/CD pipelines. See [docs/guidebooks/frontmatter-schema.md](docs/guidebooks/frontmatter-schema.md) for details.

## Future Expeditions üöÄ
