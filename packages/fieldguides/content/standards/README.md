# Standards

Core standards that define consistent approaches across all projects. These are our strongest opinions and most proven practices.

## What belongs here?

- Technology standards (e.g., `typescript-standards.md`)
- Process standards (e.g., `testing-standards.md`)
- Architecture standards (e.g., `monorepo-standards.md`)
- Practice standards (e.g., `documentation-standards.md`)

## Key characteristics

- **Prescriptive** - defines the "right way" for our projects
- **Comprehensive** - covers all aspects of the topic
- **Battle-tested** - proven across multiple production projects
- **Opinionated** - makes clear choices based on experience

## File naming

`<topic>-standards.md`

Examples:

- `typescript-standards.md`
- `testing-standards.md`
- `deployment-standards.md`
- `configuration-standards.md`

## Current Standards

- **Configuration**: Environment management with Zod validation
- **Deployment**: CI/CD and release practices
- **Documentation**: Writing clear, maintainable docs
- **Monorepo**: Managing multi-package repositories
- **React Components**: Component architecture patterns
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing methodology
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development practices
