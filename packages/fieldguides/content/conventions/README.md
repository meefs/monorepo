- **Language conventions** - TypeScript 5.7+ configuration, modern syntax
patterns
- **Testing methodology** - TDD workflow, dual framework support (Vitest/Jest)
- **Code organization** - File structure, naming patterns, module boundaries
- **Tooling setup** - ESLint flat configs, Biome/Prettier formatting

## Current Conventions

- [TypeScript Conventions](./typescript-conventions.md) - TypeScript 5.7+ with
strict safety and modern patterns
- [Testing Philosophy](./testing-philosophy.md) - TDD workflow with Vitest/Jest
dual support
- [Testing Organization](./testing-organization.md) - Colocated tests with
performance benchmarking

## Key characteristics

- **Opinionated by default** - Strong recommendations based on proven patterns
- **Modern-first** - Prioritize 2025 best practices with pragmatic legacy
support
- **Type-safe** - Leverage TypeScript 5.7+ features for maximum correctness
- **Performance-aware** - Built-in benchmarking and optimization patterns
