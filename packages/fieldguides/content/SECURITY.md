technologies. These standards establish a security-first development mindset for
2025 and beyond, addressing modern threats and leveraging contemporary security
tools.

## Foundational Security Principles

### Least Privilege

- Grant only minimum necessary permissions by default
- Regularly review and revoke unused access automatically
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Apply to users, services, systems, and API endpoints
- Implement just-in-time (JIT) access for elevated permissions
- Use environment separation with different access levels

### Defense in Depth

- Layer multiple security controls at every level
- Assume any control can fail or be bypassed
- No single point of failure in security architecture
- Combine preventive, detective, and responsive controls
- Implement security at network, application, and data layers
- Use zero-trust architecture principles

### Fail Securely

- Default to denying access (deny by default)
- Handle errors without exposing sensitive information
- Maintain security posture during failures and degraded states
- Log security events for analysis and incident response
- Implement graceful degradation with security intact
- Use circuit breakers for external dependencies

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Requirements

- Use strong, proven authentication methods (OAuth 2.1, OIDC)
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) everywhere
- Support passwordless authentication (WebAuthn, passkeys)
- Secure password policies and bcrypt/argon2 storage
- Regular session validation and token refresh
- Implement account lockout and rate limiting
- Use modern identity providers (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth)

### Authorization Patterns

- Separate authentication from authorization clearly
- Implement consistent access control across all endpoints
- Use established patterns (RBAC, ABAC, ReBAC)
- Audit authorization decisions and access patterns
- Use attribute-based policies for fine-grained control
- Implement resource-based authorization where needed
- Use policy engines for complex authorization logic

### Session Management

- Generate cryptographically secure session tokens
- Implement proper timeout policies (idle and absolute)
- Invalidate sessions on logout and privilege changes
- Protect against session hijacking and fixation
- Use secure, httpOnly, sameSite cookies
- Implement concurrent session limits where appropriate
- Use JWT tokens with proper validation and rotation

## Input Validation & Threat Prevention

### Validation Strategy

- Validate all external inputs with schema validation (Zod, Joi, Yup)
- Use allowlists over denylists for better security
- Validate on multiple layers (client, API, database)
- Reject invalid data early with descriptive errors
- Implement input length and rate limits
- Use type-safe validation with TypeScript integration
- Implement request body size limits

### Common Attack Prevention

- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries, ORMs, and prepared statements
- **XSS**: Encode output, validate input, use CSP headers, sanitize HTML
- **CSRF**: Use anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, and double-submit cookies
- **Path Traversal**: Validate file paths, use sandboxing, restrict file access
- **NoSQL Injection**: Validate and sanitize NoSQL queries, use ODMs
- **Command Injection**: Avoid shell execution, use safe APIs, validate inputs
- **LDAP Injection**: Escape LDAP special characters, use parameterized queries
- **XXE**: Disable XML external entities, use safe parsers
- **SSRF**: Validate URLs, use allowlists, restrict network access

### Data Sanitization

- Remove or escape dangerous characters contextually
- Validate data types, ranges, and formats strictly
- Check file uploads thoroughly (type, size, content, malware)
- Sanitize before storage and display
- Use content security policies (CSP) for XSS prevention
- Implement proper URL and HTML sanitization
- Use DOMPurify or similar for client-side sanitization

## Secret Management

## Summary

Security is not a feature but a fundamental requirement that must be integrated
into every aspect of modern software development. These standards provide a
comprehensive baseline for secure software development and operations in 2025
and beyond.

Key principles for modern security:

- **Security by design**: Build security into every component from the start
- **Zero trust**: Never trust, always verify at every layer
- **Continuous monitoring**: Security is an ongoing process, not a checkpoint
- **Automation first**: Automate security wherever possible for consistency
- **Shared responsibility**: Security is everyone's responsibility, not just the
  security team
- **Adaptive defense**: Security must evolve with threats and new attack vectors
- **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security controls at every level

Remember: Security requires constant vigilance, continuous learning, and
proactive adaptation to emerging threats and technologies. The goal is not
perfect security but resilient systems that can detect, respond to, and recover
from security incidents quickly.
