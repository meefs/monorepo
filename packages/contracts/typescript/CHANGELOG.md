# @outfitter/contracts

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 475b9aa: Add sub-path exports for fine-grained imports and better tree-shaking

  You can now import from specific modules to reduce bundle size:

  ```typescript
  // New sub-path imports (tree-shakable)
  import { makeError } from '@outfitter/contracts/error';
  import { success, failure } from '@outfitter/contracts/result';
  import { assert } from '@outfitter/contracts/assert';
  import { createUserId } from '@outfitter/contracts/branded';
  import { DeepReadonly } from '@outfitter/contracts/types';

  // Existing barrel import (still works)
  import { makeError, success, failure } from '@outfitter/contracts';
  ```

  This is a non-breaking change - all existing imports continue to work. The sub-path
  exports enable better tree-shaking and smaller bundles for applications that only use
  a subset of the utilities.

  Note: Sub-path exports require Node.js â‰¥ 18.12 or a modern bundler that supports the
  package.json "exports" field.
