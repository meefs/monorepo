# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the Outfitter monorepo.

## Contents

- [Monorepo Design](monorepo-design.md) - Core monorepo architecture decisions
- [Package Boundaries](package-boundaries.md) - How packages are organized and
  interact

## Purpose

Architecture documents capture the "why" behind our technical decisions. They
differ from standards and conventions by focusing on:

- System design rationale
- Trade-off analysis
- Long-term technical vision
- Cross-cutting architectural concerns

## Creating New Architecture Docs

When adding new architecture documentation:

1. Use descriptive filenames (kebab-case)
2. Include context and alternatives considered
3. Document the decision rationale
4. Link to relevant code or examples
