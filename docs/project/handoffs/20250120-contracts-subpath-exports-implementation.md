# Handoff: @outfitter/contracts Sub-path Exports Implementation

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Implementer**: Max (Claude Code)  
**Branch**: `feat/contracts-subpath-exports`  
**Base Branch**: `feat/monorepo-support-and-linked-packages`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete - Ready for PR

## Summary

Successfully implemented sub-path exports for `@outfitter/contracts` as outlined in [Proposal 008](../../proposals/008-contracts-subpath-exports.md). This feature enables better tree-shaking and smaller bundle sizes for consumers who only need specific utilities from the package.

## What Was Done

### 1. Build Configuration Updates

**File**: `packages/contracts/typescript/tsup.config.ts`
- Added multiple entry points for each module
- Enabled tree-shaking with `treeshake: true`
- Kept `splitting: false` to avoid shared chunks that defeat tree-shaking
- Added custom `outExtension` to generate `.mjs` files for ESM format

```typescript
entry: [
  'src/index.ts',            // root barrel
  'src/error.ts',
  'src/result.ts', 
  'src/assert.ts',
  'src/types/index.ts',
  'src/types/branded.ts',
]
```

### 2. Package.json Exports Field

**File**: `packages/contracts/typescript/package.json`
- Added comprehensive exports field with sub-path mappings
- Each export includes `types`, `import`, `require`, and `default` conditions
- Added `sideEffects: false` for better tree-shaking
- Added Node.js engine requirement: `>=14.13`

### 3. Testing

**File**: `packages/contracts/typescript/src/__tests__/subpath-exports.test.ts`
- Created comprehensive backward compatibility tests
- Tests verify both root barrel and sub-path imports work
- Tests ensure exports are identical between import methods
- All 13 tests passing

### 4. Documentation

**File**: `packages/contracts/typescript/README.md`
- Added new "Sub-path Exports (v1.1.0+)" section
- Provided clear examples of both import styles
- Documented Node.js version requirements

### 5. Changeset

**File**: `.changeset/contracts-subpath-exports.md`
- Created changeset for v1.1.0 minor release
- Documented the change with examples
- Emphasized backward compatibility

## Key Learnings & Discoveries

### 1. File Structure Mapping
The actual file structure differed slightly from the proposal:
- ‚úÖ All core files existed as expected
- üîç `humanize` and `formatForDevelopers` are in `errors/humanize.ts`, not `error.ts`
- üîç No `brand`, `unbrand`, or `isBranded` utility functions exist (only types and validators)

### 2. Build Output Structure
- tsup generates both `.mjs` (ESM) and `.js` (CJS) files
- TypeScript declarations are generated separately via `tsc --emitDeclarationOnly`
- File sizes are reasonable: largest is `index.mjs` at 14.28 KB

### 3. Testing Considerations
- Type exports (like `UserId`, `Email`) cannot be tested with `toBeDefined()`
- Focus tests on functions and runtime values, not type definitions
- The existing test suite has some unrelated failures (10 failing tests) that predate this work

### 4. Export Naming Differences
Several functions have different names than initially expected:
- `map` and `mapError` instead of `mapSuccess` and `mapFailure`
- `all` instead of `combine`
- `getOrElse` instead of `unwrapOr` (though `unwrapOr` also exists)

### 5. Zero Dependencies Maintained
The implementation successfully maintains the zero runtime dependencies requirement of the core package.

## Testing & Validation

### Build Verification
```bash
cd packages/contracts/typescript
pnpm build
```
‚úÖ Builds successfully with all entry points

### Test Execution
```bash
pnpm test src/__tests__/subpath-exports.test.ts --run
```
‚úÖ All 13 subpath export tests pass

### Import Verification
Both import styles work correctly:
```typescript
// Sub-path imports (new)
import { makeError } from '@outfitter/contracts/error';
import { success } from '@outfitter/contracts/result';

// Root barrel (existing)
import { makeError, success } from '@outfitter/contracts';
```

## Next Steps

1. **Create PR**: Target `feat/monorepo-support-and-linked-packages` branch
2. **Version & Publish**: Run changeset version & publish when ready
3. **Migration Guide**: Consider creating a codemod for automated migration (as outlined in proposal)
4. **Bundle Size Testing**: Measure actual tree-shaking improvements in a real project

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Additional Sub-paths**: Consider adding more granular paths for specific branded types
2. **ESLint Rule**: Create custom rule to encourage sub-path imports in new code
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Add tooling to measure and track bundle size improvements
4. **Migration Tooling**: Implement the ts-morph codemod described in the proposal

## Known Issues

- Pre-existing test failures (10) unrelated to this change
- Some linting warnings in the broader monorepo
- The `cause` vs `originalError` naming inconsistency in error handling
