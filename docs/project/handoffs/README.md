# Project Handoffs

This directory contains handoff documents that capture significant changes, migrations, or feature implementations in the Outfitter monorepo.

## Naming Convention

All handoff files follow the pattern:

```text
YYYYMMDDhhmm-<descriptive-title>.md
```

Where:

- `YYYY` - 4-digit year
- `MM` - 2-digit month (01-12)
- `DD` - 2-digit day (01-31)
- `hh` - 2-digit hour in 24-hour format (00-23)
- `mm` - 2-digit minute (00-59)
- `<descriptive-title>` - Kebab-case descriptive title

## Current Handoffs

- `202506101749-monorepo-build-system-analysis.md` - Analysis of TypeScript
monorepo build system issues and solution strategies

## Purpose

Handoff documents serve as:

- Historical record of major changes
- Context for future developers
- Technical decision documentation
- Architecture analysis and recommendations
- Migration guides for complex changes

## Creating a New Handoff

When creating a new handoff document:

1. Use the current timestamp when the work is completed
2. Choose a clear, descriptive title
3. Include:
   - Overview of changes
   - Key decisions made
   - Technical analysis and root causes
   - Multiple solution paths with trade-offs
   - Breaking changes and migration notes
   - Verification steps and checklists
   - References and supporting documentation

## Guidelines

- **Be thorough**: Future developers will use these to understand complex
decisions
- **Explore alternatives**: Document the paths not taken and why
- **Include context**: Explain the business and technical drivers
- **Provide actionable steps**: Clear next steps for implementation
- **Think long-term**: Consider maintenance and evolution implications
